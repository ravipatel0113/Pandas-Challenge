# Pandas-Challenge

I have choose Heroes of Pymoli for this challenge, as I am a game lover myself.

It was great working with the pandas, library really makes the work lot easy for all of us, and knowing this make this much easier for developers. The challenge was great though a bit easy due to the library.

All the cells are running without error and outputs are coming just the way asked for. The repeated use of functions like groupby, DataFrame, map formatting, sorting, etc. made me memorise the format. 

Challenge is done lloking for further challenges.
